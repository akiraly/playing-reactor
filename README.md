# Intro to Reactive Programming on the JVM with Reactor
Links, materials and notes about reactive programming with reactor

# What is Reactive Programming?

> Reactive programming [...] is a subset of asynchronous programming and a paradigm where the availability of new information drives the logic forward rather than having control flow driven by a thread-of-execution. [[ref](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/reactive-programming-vs-reactive-systems)]

# Reactive Programming vs Reactive System

They are not the same thing!

> A reactive system is an architectural style that allows multiple individual applications to coalesce as a single unit, reacting to its surroundings, while remaining aware of each otherâ€”this could manifest as being able to scale up/down, load balancing, and even taking some of these steps proactively. [[ref](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/reactive-programming-vs-reactive-systems)]

We are focusing on Reactive Programming (the coding part) here not on the System.

# Reactive Programming on the JVM

1. [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org): The API + TCK
1. [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava): Java 6 (and Android) compatible implementation of Reactive Streams
1. *[Reactor](http://projectreactor.io)*: Java 8 based implementation of Reactive Streams. Developed by the Spring Team, to be used in Spring 5 and onwards.
1. Java 9 Flow API: The Reactive Streams API copy pasted into [java.util.concurrent.Flow](http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/index.html?java/util/concurrent/Flow.html) class. More details [here](https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-1006738)

We are focusing on Reactor here.

# The Reactive Streams API

```java
public interface Publisher<T> {
    void subscribe(Subscriber<? super T> s);
}

public interface Subscriber<T> {
    void onSubscribe(Subscription s);
    void onNext(T t);
    void onError(Throwable t);
    void onComplete();
}

public interface Subscription {
    void request(long n);
    void cancel();
}

public interface Processor<T, R> extends Subscriber<T>, Publisher<R> {}
```
